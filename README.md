# portfolio
This is a portfolio style page i made for a friend. They wished for a retro/final fantasy styled page so i mocked this one up.
I think it's quite cute, i might use this version for myself, but at the moment it is just a mockup and the descriptions are mostly placeholders and not thought through. 

Feel free to steal/use this if you like it. Since the style is so heavily based on what i remember from old FF games it's not like a can claim some kind of originality/attribution for it. But if you like it a mention is always welcome.
